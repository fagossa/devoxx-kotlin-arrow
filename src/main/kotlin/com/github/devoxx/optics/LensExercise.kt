/*
 * Optics are essentially abstractions to update immutable data structures in an elegant way.
 * A Lens (aka functional reference) is an optic that can focus into a structure and get, modify, or set its focus (target).
 * Theyâ€™re mostly used for product types such as a data class or a TupleN.
 *
 * Lenses can be seen as a pair of functions, a getter, and a setter.
 * A Lens<S, A> represents a getter: get: (S) -> A, and setter: (A) -> (S) -> S,
 * where S is called the source of the Lens and A is called the focus or target of the Lens.
